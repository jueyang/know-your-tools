## What is a branch? Part 2

The [official git documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) is chill this time; it explains the concept with a fitting example in plain English, which you might find useful. 

Sometimes you might like to table whatever mind-boggling css positioning you are working on at the moment, and switch to working on the Javascript you intend to use on that page.

For that purpose, this would be your workflow:

1. pause whatever you've worked on. At this moment, you've probably been only working on the `master`.
2. create a new branch and work on that one.
3. when you've done working on the new branch, merge it with with your main body of work, aka `master`.

_Remember me, the tree?_

Merging is like taking a branch that has grown and graft it back to the main stem. Fortunately in git, it's not as gnarly as it is in bonsai.

## Practice

This is based in the js repo you've been using in this class:

1. From your current branch `master`, create a branch with `git checkout -b reset`
2. Do you see `On branch reset`? Good.
3. `git checkout master`
4. `git merge reset` - Oh things are happening.
6. `git status`. What do you see?
7. Push for real (You will see the change in the `master`)

In this case you have only worked locally. When you are collaborating with others you will actually push your changes to a remote branch so that other people can see your changes (and collaborate on the right branch.) So rather than switching to `master` in step 3, you commit and push to the branch `reset`. Now you will see this branch appearing on your GitHub repo.

While you could merge just as you did above, merging a remote branch should properly involve something called a **pull request**. We will talk about that more once you start collaborating with each other. And trust me, it will happen.

## Introducing the concept of production branch

Review a good workflow (hint: commit often.)

It matters to have a production branch. Say you've been working on your web page, and you decide to add a feature that takes you more than a few pushes. You would not want anyone who visit your page to see something broken or half-done. In this case, keep the public-facing work as it is, and branch off of that to continue working on your new thing.

The unbroken, steady version is your production branch. Question: **what is your production branch for your webpage?**

Next question: **keeping your production branch unchanged, what would you do if you would like to add some js experimentation to your page?**
