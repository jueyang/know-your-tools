## Work with your team

...by **fork**ing and submitting **pull requests**.

First, form your teams and establish a point person.

## The Story of Three(ish) Little Circles

![](http://cl.ly/1D1r2o2k221o/fork-schematic.png)

1. Point person creates a repo for your project.
2. Teammates fork the repo to their own accounts.
3. Clone your respective remote of the repo. Point person has the "original" repo, teammmates have the forked repo and **Divvy up!**
  - Point person: add an `index.html` and add the names of your team in that file. Use `<li>`.
  - Teammate A: add a `site.js`. For now the file consists of one line: `console.log('This will be the js used by the project.')`.
  - Teammate B: add a `site.css`. For now the file consists of one style: `body>* {box-sizing: border-box;}`.
4. Everyone will add, commit, push to their respective repo.
5. **Consolidate**
  - Teammate A and B create pull requests.
  - Point person accepts the pull request.
6. **Keep updated**
  - Teammate A and B add another remote of the "original" repo from point person, as `upstream`.
  - Teammate A and B **pull** from the `upstream` to get the most up-to-date version of their project.

Have a good day! 🚀🍻🔛
