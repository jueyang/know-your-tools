### Things you should do for the class

1. Bring your laptop!
2. Download [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/). It's the interface we will use. (Mac users only)
3. Play [Terminus](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/) before class, a game that would get you more comfortable with typing commands and using no mice. If you find the pony from the game, take a screenshot of it and I'll have a prize for you in class.

### The following is optional, but if you'd like

1. Find a dataset of your interest. We might have time to work on it after the sample dataset in class!

**Let me know if you don't use a mac, since you would be installing a few more things.**

That's all. See you on Monday!
